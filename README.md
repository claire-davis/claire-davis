## Get to know me!
My name is Claire and I'm in my fifth year of physics 🔭 and neuroscience 🧠

### Why are you enrolled in this class


### What got me interested in neuroscience?
I started off my undergrad as a physics major but after my second year I wasn't super happy in the program. One of my roommates at the time was in neuroscience and would tell me about what she was learning in classes and I found everything she told me to be interesting. She encouraged me to take neuro classes so I picked up the neuro major and have thoroughly enjoyed it ever since. 

### My post graduation plans 👩‍🎓
Post-grad I plan on doing my masters in epidemiology (🤞). I'm not entirely sure what I want to do after that but as of right now I want to work in a healthcare related field.
