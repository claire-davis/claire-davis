## Get to know me!
My name is Claire and I'm in my fifth year of physics 🔭 and neuroscience 🧠

### Why am I enrolled in this class?
I've taken a couple python courses other years but I haven't been a big fan of how they were structured and a lot of what they taught didn't stick. I figured where this is a lab class, it'll be more hands on and since it's a neuro course I think it'll be a lot more interesting than the other python courses I've taken.

### What got me interested in neuroscience?
I started off my undergrad as a physics major but after my second year I wasn't super happy in the program. One of my roommates at the time was in neuroscience and would tell me about what she was learning in classes and I found everything she told me to be interesting. She encouraged me to take neuro classes so I picked up the neuro major and have thoroughly enjoyed it ever since. 

### My post graduation plans 👩‍🎓
Ultimately I want to work in healthcare but I'm not entirely sure what kind of work I want to do. I plan on applying to masters programs and I have two paths I'm considering at the moment:
1. A masters in epidemiology - definitely my first choice for when I graduate
2. A masters in medical physics - I'm doing my honours project with a medical physicist so I figured if I enjoy the research I'm doing it wouldn't hurt to apply
